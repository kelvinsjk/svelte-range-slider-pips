## Minimal Configuration
<Icon name="twemoji:fire" /> The most basic example is to provide a `min`, `max` and `value` prop. 
This will render a Slider with a single handle.

<Demo name="Default (useless) Slider" client:visible>
  <RangeSlider min={0} max={100} values={[10]} client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={UselessRaw} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

But this is kind of useless! Unless you just want a pretty UI toy to play with! <Icon name="twemoji:face-with-tears-of-joy" />
Because once rendered to the page, there's no feedback upon interaction.



## Binding the values

Typically we would want to be able to use the values of the Slider in our application. This
could either be to change another part of the interface in a Rich Internet Application, or to
send the values to a server as part of a Form.

<Demo name="Basic Binding to an <input>" client:visible>
  <BasicBinding client:visible />
  <Code code={BasicBindingRaw} lang="svelte" slot="svelte" />
</Demo>



## Common Setup

The most common use case is to allow a user to select a value
from a range of values. Using the special feature of `pips` to render
beside the Slider to hint at the progress. It's also common to show a `float` value
above the handle to help the user see the exact value they are selecting.

Again; we are binding to a `values[]` variable so that the Slider's value can be
used in our application.

<Demo name="A typically styled Range Slider with pips" client:visible>
  <TypicalUsage client:visible />
  <Code code={TypicalUsageRaw} lang="svelte" slot="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note type="info" title="Clicky Labels">
  When displaying labels below a Slider (`first=label`, `last=label`), this also enables them to be
  interactive. Clicking on a label will move the closest handle to that value.
